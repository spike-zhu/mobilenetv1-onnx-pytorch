# MobileNet V1 ONNX Export with PyTorch

This repository provides a PyTorch implementation of the MobileNet V1 architecture, along with scripts to export the model to the ONNX format. 
MobileNet V1 is a lightweight deep neural network architecture designed for mobile and embedded vision applications. 
Despite its widespread use, there is limited code available for generating MobileNet V1 ONNX files, so I implemented this repository to fill the gap.„ÄÅ

## Features
- Custom PyTorch implementation of MobileNet V1.
- Support for exporting the model to ONNX format.
- Compatible with inference frameworks like TensorRT and ONNX Runtime.
- Example scripts for testing the exported ONNX model.

## Environment
This project was developed and tested in the following environment:
- Python = 3.10
- PyTorch = 2.0.0
- ONNX = 1.17.0
- ONNX Runtime (optional, for testing ONNX models)
